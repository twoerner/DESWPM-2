all development/programming on openSuSE 11.4

use mplabx to code and compile (beta 7.01)

use "pk2cmd" to program:
	$ pk2cmd -PPIC16F84A -R -T -F led1a.X.production.hex -M -Y

	-P<part>	select chip
	-R		release /MCLR when done
	-T		power device when done
	-F<hex>		hex file to program
	-M		region to program, in this case entire device
	-Y		verify region, in this case entire device

	other good options:
	-Z		preserve EEPROM

	NOTE: this can be done as a regular user
	NOTE: the '-M' option also causes an erase to happen before pgm
	NOTE: the order of the cmdline args is irrelevant, pk2cmd sorts
	      and runs them in the most sensible order

other uses of pk2cmd
	to simply power and run the device:
		$ pk2cmd -P -T -R

		NOTE: the -P option by itself causes a self-detect algorithm
		      to run, this algo takes a couple seconds, to speed it
		      up specify the device yourself (i.e. -PPIC16F84A)

	to dump a range of program memory:
		$ pk2cmd -PPIC16F84A -GP0-30

	to display the configuration bits:
		$ pk2cmd -PPIC16F84A -GC
	
	to dump the entire chip contents to a file (out.hex):
		$ pk2cmd -PPIC16F84A -GFout.hex
	
	to turn off the device (stop power from pickit2):
		$ pk2cmd -PPIC16F84A
